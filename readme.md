# State Machine Demo

Demo designed for a potential YouTube video on the subject of
state machines.

## Supported text characters

While ideally I should support at least the full ASCII set, I opted
to support a smaller number of characters to simplify the example.

```text
µ� !"#$%&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~
```
